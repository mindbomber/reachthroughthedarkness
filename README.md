a book on how to find sanity in this insane world


truths:
only a small few today are able to see through the madness. it is increasingly more difficult for the common people, especially the poor and uneducated, to experience sanity when the majority of the population is mad, including the majority of what is presented in the media.
people need to get back to nature
a lot of people and generations that came before have messed it up for the rest of us
